# Francigena_Project

This is an exercise for learning purposes: a rudimentary project for a dynamic Web Application whose objective would be to provide easier access to information about hotels, restaurants, facilities and maps along the Via Francigena, the ancient Route that connects Canterbury to Rome.

Information should be shown on-demand through dynamic API calls and static JSON files. The following technologies, methods and libraries have been used: HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQUERY, Leaflet, jquery-lang, Ajax, for loop, JSON arrays, a language package.
